# Night Sky Satellite Viewer

## What is this?
It's an android app that lets you view (almost) all of the world's satellites in real-time on android devices! An MP4 shows the current features of our app, including smart clustering of satellites at different zoom levels, search functionality and click recognition on satellites.

## Where can I find it?
For right now no official release exists. For now the easiest way to get it running is pointing Android Studio to the night-sky-satellite-viewer folder and launching to your target device.

## Whats next?
We are working on many cool features, a few of which are documented [here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snepgEGfFk7aDqji6l7ntQWtisTFIfj868kbaTe_eik/edit?usp=sharing) For now our primary development goals are to improve core usability with features like... 
- Creating filter satellites by...
  - favorites (done?)
  - prefix/suffix
  - group
  - country
  - etc...
- Projecting the satellite's orbits
- Supplying expanded satellite information
- Setting up an offline database updating service
- And much more!

## Hey doofuses, you have no software license!
Good point! For the time being this app will be under the default (and most strict) software license.

## Let me give you code for free!
Not yet! While we have refactored much of our original code, theres some tech debt that should be paid off before we start asking for help with features.
