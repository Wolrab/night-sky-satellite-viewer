# Night Sky Satellite Viewer

## What is this?
It's an android app that lets you view (almost) all of the world's satellites in realtime on android devices!

## Where can I find it?
For right now no official release exists. For now the easiest way to get it running is pointing Android Studio to the night-sky-satellite-viewer folder and launching to your target device.

## Whats next?
We are working on many cool features, a few of which are documented [here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snepgEGfFk7aDqji6l7ntQWtisTFIfj868kbaTe_eik/edit?usp=sharing) For now our primary development goals are to improve core usability with features like... 
- Creating filter satellites by...
  - favorites (done?)
  - prefix/suffix
  - group
  - country
  - etc...
- Projecting the satellite's orbits
- Supplying expanded satellite information
- Setting up an offline database updating service
- And much more!

## Hey doofuses, you have no software license!
Good point! We will likely choose some open source license but for now this app will be under the default (and most strict) software license.

## Let me give you code for free!
Yes! Submit a pull request and we will do our best to respond. Expertise in __astronomy,__ __orbital mechanics__ or general knowledge of __real-time physics simulations__ would be greatly appreciated c:
